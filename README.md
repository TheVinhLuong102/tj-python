# SteamingHotPie
A branch devoted to the development of `streaming.py`.

## To-do list
- [ ] Stabilize the whole thing
- [ ] Use logger instead of `if __debug__`
- [ ] Figure out Speaker Diarization
- [ ] Figure out Customization
- [ ] Figure out Tone Analysis
- [ ] Get rid of that `time.sleep` thing
- [ ] Keep the websocket open and listening the whole time.

Once these are all done this branch will be merged back into master and deleted.
For now, the master branch will be using the SpeechRecognition package from pypi.
